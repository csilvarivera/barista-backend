# Cymbal Coffee Backend Beans

Welcome Cymbal Coffee Competitor! This is the app you will be using to win our business!

No, it's not written in Java! It's a simple app written in Go. You don't need to read the code or even understand how it works! All you have to do is get it running!hghg

## How do I get started?

It's up to you! We've included a `Dockerfile` in case you wish to containerise it. We've also included a simple `app.yaml` in case you want to run it somewhere else.

The app has no dependencies at first. It's stateless and can be run many times. It will write various logs about what's happening, so if things aren't working maybe check them out.

If you are not running it in Google Cloud you should set the environment variable `PROJECT_ID` to the ID of your project. Not all tasks will work outside of Google Cloud.

If you are really stuck, please ask one of your specialists for help!

### How does the app work?

To score our competitors we have a spy service - _bond_ - that this app communicates with. If it can't reach bond - or if it's not been registered - the app will crash. Your tasks that you run through will validate their configuration with Bond.

You can take a look at its source code if you like. Maybe there are bonus points for hacking it? Maybe you'll lose points instead!

## Testing

To test locally, please ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
2. [Go](https://go.dev/)

Alternatively, Docker (and go) comes pre-installed on Google Cloud Workstations, and in Google Cloud Shell. Feel free to run the tests using Google Cloud.

### Testing with Go

To run our tests using go:

```bash
go test -v
```

### Testing with Docker

To run our tests in Docker, there is an included file apt-ly named [Dockerfile.qa](Dockerfile.qa). This can be built and run locally or used in a CI/CD pipeline.

When running in Google Cloud Shell the project id is a local ENV named `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`.

```bash
docker build -t backend-service-test:latest --build-arg project_id="$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" -f Dockerfile.qa .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run backend-service-test:latest
```

### Testing with Scripts

To run our tests using the included script:

```bash
./test.sh
```

## Hacking

Of course hacking is encouraged. If you can get points quickly and easily, then maybe you should? Don't cheat of course, but if you find ways to get points in the code or elsewhere then maybe given them a go?

Can't figure it out? Ask your specialists!

## Help!

If you are really stuck and don't want to ask for help then consider running this app in Cloud Run or App Engine.
